# HomeworkFive

It must be noted that all of the definitions have been obtained from: https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html

Product backlog refinement (information obtained from https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-backlog and https://www.digite.com/agile/backlog-refinement/):  

This is an ongoing process, where the product owner (detailed below) and development team (detailed below) collaborate and make sure that the tasks are understood by all the individuals involved, have the same relative complexity and ordered in such a manner than reflects the priority of the business and the amount of effort required.

Sprint planning (information obtained from https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#sprint-planning): 

Sprint planning occurs at the start of the sprint (typically 1 month periods), and this is where the scrum team collaborates and plans the sprint, with the product owner (PO) and scrum team (ST). Typically, for a 1-month sprint, up to 8 hours is set aside for sprint planning. In sprint planning, the PO focuses on raising product value, and the ST finalises the sprint goal to explain the purpose of the sprint and show its value to the stakeholders. The second thing to be addressed is what is being done in the sprint. The PO and developers using the product backlog and decide what items will be in this current sprint and their definition of done (defining the quality for the backlog items). To decide what work gets done, for each item in the product backlog the development team will create an increment (a smaller task towards a product goal) and then how that relates to the definition of done. The developers will break these tasks down into smaller increments. 

In essence, sprint planning is a collaborative effort that defines what needs to be achieved, and how it can be achieved.

Daily scrum (information obtained from https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#daily-scrum and https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-daily-scrum):

This is typically timeboxed as a 15-minute event that looks at the progress towards the sprint goal, and subsequently if the sprint backlog needs to be altered. The aim is to create a plan for the workday so that each member is able to focus on the tasks ahead and reduce the need for additional meetings.

Sprint review (information obtained from https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#sprint-review): 

The aim of the sprint review is to see the outcome and look at directions to go down in the future. They also show the stakeholders the work and how they are working towards their product goal. Product backlog may be altered slightly, depending on if there are different/new opportunities that need to be met. It is important to note that the timebox allowance for this is 4 hours (for a 1-month sprint). 

Sprint retrospective (information obtained from https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#sprint-retrospective): 

This is the final stage of the sprint, that is typically timeboxed to 3 hours for a 1-month sprint. This discusses what went well, things that caused them slight problems and to go astray. The sprint retrospective also looks at the challenges or difficulties faced, how they overcame them, or how they could overcome them in the future. The whole scrum team will then use this information to improve the effectiveness and productivity of the team.  

Scrum roles:
Scrum master (information obtained from https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-master and https://premieragile.com/scrummaster-service-to-the-organization/#:~:text=A%20Scrum%20Master%20can%20develop,of%20Scrum%20in%20the%20organization):  

The scrum master has an important job because they are the leaders and they establish the scrum. They serve 3 levels of the business: the scrum team, product owner and the organisation as a whole. 

They serve the scrum team by coaching members, creating increments that are releasable to the public (and therefore meet the definition of done), and ensures that the scrum events occur within the allocated timebox (and are productive). The ways they serve the product owner is by defining the product goal, which are essentially the objectives of the project. Lastly, they help the scrum team with backlog items. The way they serve the organisation is by planning/organising the Scrum, and breaking down barriers between stakeholders and team. 

Product owner (information obtained from https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#product-owner): 

The role of the product owner is to maximise product value and to manage to the product backlog and will often take into consideration the needs of the stakeholders. The way they can manage the product backlog is by communicating the product goal and order and communicate the product backlog items so that everyone understands them clearly.

Development team (information obtained from https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#developers and https://www.qrpinternational.be/blog/glossary/who-is-the-scrum-developer-role-and-responsabilities/#:~:text=The%20Scrum%20Developer%20is%20the,Master%20and%20the%20Development%20Team):

These are the people in the scrum team that create deliverables (which is the product or service). They create/plan the sprint task (the sprint backlog). They ensure that they are creating a quality product, by sticking to the definition of done, which is the standard required for the product/service to be releasable.
